The following videos were created by Dr. Yu Gu, with contributions from Kyle Hounsell and Dimitri Megretski, and are used with permission.{{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/lab-videos/lab-1-dc-motors" section="Lab Videos" title="Lab 1: DC Motors" description="Description: This is an introductory lab designed to introduce you to the oscilloscope and MATLAB. You will measure the angular velocity of your home-built motor and characterize a DC motor by measuring its motor constant. Speaker: Yu Gu" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/97G6FGS2JC0/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/lab-videos/lab-2-shooting-magnets" section="Lab Videos" title="Lab 2: Shooting Magnets" description="Description: In this lab, we will characterize a coilgun launcher. A coilgun is a device that accelerates a ferromagnetic projectile using the magnetic force. Speaker: Yu Gu" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/YBKJ9Qi2PxM/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/lab-videos/lab-3-liquid-crystal-displays" section="Lab Videos" title="Lab 3: Liquid Crystal Displays" description="Description: In this lab, we will construct and characterize a single liquid crystal pixel. The construction includes grooving the substrates to align the liquid crystals, assembling the display cell, and filling the cell with spacers and the liquid crystal material. Speaker: Yu Gu" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/rWqHLR5aSXM/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/lab-videos/lab-4-spectrometer" section="Lab Videos" title="Lab 4: Spectrometer" description="Description: In this lab you will be exploring many aspects of optics. In class you learned about light polarization, Snells law, critical angle, gratings, Fresnel equations and Brewsters angle. We will now be experimentally verifying all of these concepts. Speaker: Yu Gu" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Lq6Os-qABK4/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/lab-videos/lab-5-quantum-mechanical-tunneling" section="Lab Videos" title="Lab 5: Quantum Mechanical Tunneling" description="Description: In this lab, we will analyze a piece of material composed of nickel in rubber that exhibits a nonlinear current versus voltage (I-V) relationship due to the dominance of tunneling in the conduction process, and build a simple resistive touchpad. Speaker: Yu Gu" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/w-8_fMtNZiQ/default.jpg" >}}
